# Emberdawn

A survival crafting RPG built with Minetest.

This is a work-in-progress, and is very much not ready for
general consumption.


## Installation

This game is in development. The only reason anyone would
want to install it is if they plan to contribute to its
development or testing, so there is no convenient installer
or official release.

To install, first install [Minetest 5.4.1][1] or later. Then
clone this repository inside Minetest's `games` folder.

The directory structure should look like this:

```
minetest
├── games
│   ├── devtest
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── emberdawn
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── game.conf
│   │   └── ...
│   └── minetest_game
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

To launch the game, start Minetest, create a new world, and
select "Emberdawn" from the list of games.
